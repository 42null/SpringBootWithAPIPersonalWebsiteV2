I participated for Kettle Moraine High under team \"<i>Error: \"Team name not found\"</i>\" we placed third in the blue division (Java) which was the highest position KM had in the six years participating up until that point. I was overjoyed to do it again and while as part of the team \"Byte My Bits\" in 2022 and while we didn't place in the top, it was nice to participate in person and see the campus.

It is a great way to get experience troubleshooting computer problems, filling out support tickets, replacing parts, and working with clients.
